What is SDLC?

SDLC stands for the Software Development Life Cycle.


What are the stages of SDLC? explain 

The stages of SDLC are:

1. Identify - Find what the problem is
2. Plan - Determine the feasibility of the project, while also considering low risks
3. Design - Go over the plan and offer feedback and suggestions
4. Build - Actual development of project starts, stick to the plan
5. Test - Verify if code meets the requirements
6. Deploy - Release the product to the public so users can start using the product
7. Maintainence - Get feedback from the public and fix your product
8. Maintain - Constantly make adjustments to make the product relevant


Define five SDLC models (methodology).

1. Waterfall Model
2. Agile Model
3. Iterative Model
4. Big Bang Model 
5. Spiral Model


Take one of the SDLC models and explain the implementation process.

Waterfall Model Implementation -
The system is developed into smaller programs called units. 
Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality, known
as Unit Testing.

Describe how to apply SDLC model in the version control App.

You can apply the Waterfall Model in the version control app by 
having a clear goal of what needs to be accomplished at the
start of the project. It is straightforward and expectations 
are clear. Each phase must be fully completed before moving
on to the next one.
